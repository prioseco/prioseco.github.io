## About me:

I am Ph.D. in theoretical physics, currently CMM - U Chile postdoc (Center of Mathematical Modeling, U Chile) with a Fondecyt Grant 322â€“0767.

I specialize in General Relativity, focusing on the description of black holes, and Mathematical Physics, particularly in the Vlasov-Poisson system. My work lies at the intersection of Mathematics and Astrophysics.

My scientific interest is principally motivated by a "realistic" description of matter around Black Holes, in particular, I used a description known as Kinetic Theory of gases. By applying this approach to the matter around black holes, we seek to understand better how it behaves and interacts with extreme gravity in those regions. 

I am currently working as a Data Analyst/Scientist, utilizing programming languages such as Python and R.

## Other interests:

- Understanding the Misunderstood Pigeon: Rescue, Help, Donate, Educate.
- Sports: Bike, Functional, Hiking, Yoga.
- Outreach to women in STEM.
